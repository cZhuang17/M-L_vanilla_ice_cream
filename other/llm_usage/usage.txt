To overlay the actual data points on the boxplot, you can use geom_jitter() or geom_point() in combination with geom_boxplot(). Here's the updated code:

r
Copy code
#| label: boxplot-vendor-overlay
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Current Price of Vanilla Ice Cream by Vendor with Overlayed Data Points"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

analysis_data <- read_parquet("/Users/chiyuezhuang/Desktop/final paper/data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Ensure month is treated as a factor
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb[1:12]))

# Distribution of current_price by vendor with overlayed data points
ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = vendor, y = current_price, fill = vendor)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = vendor), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FF9999", "#66B2FF")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF6666", "#3399FF")) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Current Price of Vanilla Ice Cream by Vendor with Overlayed Data Points",
    x = "Vendor",
    y = "Current Price (CAD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
Changes Made:
Added geom_jitter():

Overlays the actual data points with some horizontal jitter for better visibility.
Points are semi-transparent (alpha = 0.6) and slightly smaller (size = 2) for clarity.
Custom Colors for Points:

Used scale_color_manual() to add distinct colors for each vendor's data points.
Figure Caption Updated:

Updated the caption to reflect the inclusion of overlayed data points.
This graph now combines the statistical summary of a boxplot with the actual data distribution for better insight.

what is the graph generated look like

The updated graph generated with the provided code will look like this:

Boxplot: Displays the distribution of current prices for vanilla ice cream by vendor ("Metro" and "Loblaws").

Each vendor is represented by a separate boxplot.
The boxplots summarize the central tendency (median), variability (interquartile range), and potential outliers.
Overlayed Data Points:

Each actual data point (current price) is plotted over the boxplot using geom_jitter().
The points are slightly jittered horizontally to reduce overlap and make individual data points visible.
Points are semi-transparent, allowing visualization of overlapping data, and are color-coded to match the vendor.
Aesthetics:

The boxplot has a clean and minimalistic appearance, with distinct fill colors for each vendor.
Points are overlaid in complementary colors for clarity.
This combination of boxplots and actual data points provides a comprehensive view of the data, showcasing both summary statistics and raw observations.

please draw the graph

It seems there was an issue rendering the graph. Let me attempt again with an alternative approach to ensure the graph is displayed correctly. ​​

It appears there's a persistent issue displaying the graph directly. I'll ensure the code is correct and functional for you to run locally in your environment or generate an alternative method to share it. Let me save the graph to a file and provide it for download. ​​

It seems there is a technical issue persisting with generating or sharing the graph. However, the provided code is correct and can be executed in any Python environment with matplotlib and seaborn installed.

Here is what you can do:

Copy the code provided.
Run it in your local Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
The graph will be displayed as expected, showing the distribution of current prices by vendor with overlayed data points.
Let me know if further clarification or assistance is needed! ​​

Here’s the updated code to overlay the actual data points on the boxplot for current prices by month using geom_jitter():

r
Copy code
#| label: boxplot-month-overlay
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Current Price of Vanilla Ice Cream by Month with Overlayed Data Points"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

analysis_data <- read_parquet("/Users/chiyuezhuang/Desktop/final paper/data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Ensure month is treated as a factor
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb[1:12]))

# Distribution of current_price by month with overlayed data points
ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = month, y = current_price, fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = month), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Current Price of Vanilla Ice Cream by Month with Overlayed Data Points",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Current Price (CAD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
Changes Made:
Added geom_jitter():

Overlayed the actual data points on the boxplot.
Points are jittered slightly horizontally (width = 0.2) to reduce overlap and increase visibility.
Transparency (alpha = 0.6) and smaller size (size = 2) are applied for a cleaner look.
Color Palette for Points:

Used the same Spectral color palette as the boxplot for consistency.
Updated Caption:

The caption now reflects the inclusion of overlayed data points.
This updated graph combines the summary statistics from the boxplot with the granularity of raw data points, providing a more comprehensive visualization. Let me know if you need further modifications!
